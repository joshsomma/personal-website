Hello and welcome! I'm living in the Big Smoke with my wife and two kids. I work for a software company as a technical director and digital change consultant. Much of my career has been spent in digital publishing and in recent years I have been working on the vendor side of things. Prior to moving to the UK I lived in NYC for over 10 years. I'm originally from the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area in northeast Pennsylvania. Get in touch or follow me on social media. My links are all here. Thanks for stopping by!
