Hello and welcome! I'm living in the Big Smoke with my wife and two kids. My work background is in developing sites and applications on the web. Prior to moving to the UK I lived in NYC for over 10 years. I'm originally from the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area in northeast Pennsylvania. Get in touch or follow me on social media. My links are all here. Thanks for stopping by!
