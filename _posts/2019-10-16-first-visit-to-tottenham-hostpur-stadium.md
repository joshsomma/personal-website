... and it was to see an NFL game of all things. Lucked upon a free ticket to see Bears vs Raiders which I believe was the first NFL game to be played in the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium. The new stadium really is impressive with great atmosphere inside. Can't wait to get to see Spurs play which will hopefully happen this season.

As I was approaching the stadium with my companion Rob, we were discussing how modern the stadium was and how it had the longest bar in Europe. I said I would be really impressed if we could walk in right up to the bar and order a beer with no wait. Sure enough, that's exactly what we were able to do. Shame that Spur's put the price up an extra Â£1.50 per pint for the NFL fans. Boo Spurs!

Anyway, here's a view from our seats in the south stand of the pre-game...
