When my Dad moved house several years back, he gave me a couple of old VHS tapes of mine that had been stored in the basement. I *finally* took the time to watch them (it's not easy finding VHS players these days!) and found this old clip of me ripping it up on Route 3 wave on the Black River in Watertown, NY.

I spent about 18 months living in Old Forge, NY in the late '90s working for <a href="https://whitewaterchallengers.com/" target="_blank">Whitewater Challengers</a> as assistant manager of one the bases. We spent *lots* of afternoons out on the Black, both on the Route 3 wave and Hole Brothers. Seeing this old clip brings me back (sigh). A big shout out to Bone wherever you are.

Sorry for the poor quality of the video but it is a 20+ year old VHS tape that I filmed with my phone.
