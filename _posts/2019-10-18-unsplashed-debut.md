Since I'd like to see how many slide decks I can make it into, I thought I'd try posting an image I took of my Arduino Uno wired up to a liquid crystal disaply and post it on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/fm8T_J7t8-s" target="new">unsplashed</a>.

If you don't want to bother clicking the link, here's the image for your viewing pleasure. More to come??
